# BoltzMAnn - A simulated-annealing-powered (Restricted) Boltzmann Machine
# Copyright (c) 2016 Emanuele Ballarin <emanuele@ballarin.cc>

# The purpose of the script is to implement a computationally-efficient and
# straightforward (optionally Restricted) Boltzmann Machine, powered under the
# hood by Simulated Annealing as a means to 'thermalize' the Hopfield net.
# The network has been developed to be as general-purpose as possible and the
# choice of the Julia language was determined as the optimal compromise between
# runtime performance, conciseness, expressiveness and high-level clarity.
